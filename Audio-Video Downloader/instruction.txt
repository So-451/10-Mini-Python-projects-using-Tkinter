While installing pytube, we have to make some changes in one of the module files named 'cipher.py'

1.    In order to solve the problem, you should go in the cipher.py file and replace the line 30, which is:

    var_regex = re.compile(r"^\w+\W")

    With that line:

    var_regex = re.compile(r"^\$*\w+\W")


2.    Changing line 287 of cipher.py to exactly

    'var {nfunc}\s*=\s*(\[.+?\])'.format(

    removing the ; at the end
